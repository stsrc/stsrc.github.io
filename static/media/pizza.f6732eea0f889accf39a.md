# Pizza recipe  
Pizza is great for experiments. You can ferment dough for a while, you can add various cheese as topping, but there are also some constraints. All constraints which are known to me are written as **bold**.
## Dough  
For 1 person you need:  
• 1¾ - 2 cups of strong flour (equals to 175 - 200g)  
• 0.5 - 0.6 cup of water (maybe more)  
• dry yeast (see information on package for dosage)  
• ½ small spoon of salt  
• 1 small spoon of sugar  
• 1 table spoon of olive oil  
  
Before making dough check if yeast is alive. To do that put yeast into small bowl, add warm (not hot) water and add sugar into it, mix it well and wait 5-15 minutes. If you will see some movement (bubbles for example) then it means that they are alive. If not - go and buy new yeast.  
To make dough simply add all dry ingredients, mix it, then gradually add yeast mixture from previous step, and gradually add water.  After the dough seems to be ready leave it for 30 minutes or 1 hour, so yeast has time to work and expand dough.
## Sauce  
For tomato sauce you need:  
• ½ can of whole tomatoes  
• ½ small spoon of oregano  
• ¼ small spoon of basil  
• ¼ small spoon of salt  
• ¼ small spoon of pepper  
• **1 table spoon of olive oil**  
  
Take out tomatoes from can but leave the sauce. Blend tomatoes. Add all remaining ingredients, and blend again. Should be ready. If it's to watery, you can reduce it by heating it on a stove.
  
## Baking  
If you are using baking plate: firstly **put flour on a baking plate** to prevent sticking pizza to the plate, but remember to put not to much of it. Then stretch dough and put it on a baking plate. Next add sauce and toppings.  
Bake at **as high temperature as your oven can stand**. Bake until it looks ready (5 minutes for 400°C, longer for lower temperatures).
